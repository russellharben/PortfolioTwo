                        <br>

                        Hi, my name is Russell and I'm a web developer from Atlanta, GA.

                        A couple years ago I began teaching myself to code in my free time

                        and am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development and Programming
                        Bootcamp.

                        <br><br>

                        In 2010 I graduated from the University of South Alabama with my BA in Communications and a
                        minor in

                        Business. After college I took a job as the Director of Marketing at a Top 40 radio station I
                        had worked

                        at for 2 years in school. Shortly after I moved back to my hometown and took a job at a
                        software development

                        company doing data analytics and account management.

                        <br><br>

                        A couple years later I moved to Florida to get out of my comfort zone for a while and took a
                        management

                        position at an EZ-GO distributor, eventually moving to outside sales. It was a great
                        experience. Still,

                        coding was something I was always interested in learning but never had time to truly dedicate
                        myself to.

                        <br><br>

                        Eventually I found an opportunity to go back to work for the software company I had previously
                        been with in Atlanta

                        and this time was afforded the opportunity to start spending some time at work teaching myself
                        the basics of

                        web development and programming. I sharpened my skills just enough that I was able to land a
                        few freelance

                        projects outside of work building strictly frontend, static websites for two local businesses
                        and a third for a

                        logistics company in Richmond, Virginia.

                        <br><br>

                        These were outstanding learning experiences and ultimately led to opportunities at work to do
                        some frontend

                        design and coding. Our current clients, among others, include GPC, Target, Hunter Douglas,
                        McKesson, JW Pepper,

                        and more.
